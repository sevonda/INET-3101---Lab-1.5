## Overview
Lab 1.5 explores dynamic memory allocation and data structures, including static and dynamic arrays, linked lists, object-oriented programming concepts, and the use of custom headers.

## Topics Covered

### UsesStaticArray

### MallocPrinter

### SimpleDynamicExercise

### PythonLists
#### Objects in OOP
- Objects are instances of classes containing attributes (data) and methods (functions).
- They represent real-world entities or concepts.

### Linked Lists
- Linked lists solve memory allocation issues by dynamically assigning values and linking them arbitrarily.
- Useful for dynamic data storage and creating an ordered sequence of elements.
- Example output:
  ```
  Linked List: 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> NULL
  ```

### Managing Allocation
- Demonstrates controlled dynamic memory allocation and management.
- Example output:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 ... 44 %
  ```

### Headers in C
- Custom headers require a different compilation process than standard library headers.
- Header files (`.h`) provide function declarations, while implementation is in separate `.c` files.
