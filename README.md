## Overview
Lab 1.5 explores dynamic memory allocation and data structures, including static and dynamic arrays, linked lists, object-oriented programming concepts, and the use of custom headers.

---

## Topics Covered

### UsesStaticArray
- Implementation details missing, but likely involves static arrays where memory is preallocated at compile time.

### MallocPrinter
- Demonstrates the use of `malloc()` for dynamic memory allocation.
- Allows users to specify memory allocation size.
- Provides an interactive experience where users can continuously add numbers to a dynamically allocated array.
- Uses a while loop to allow infinite memory reallocation in the heap until the user decides to stop by entering a letter.
- Prints the final values stored in the dynamically allocated array.

### SimpleDynamicExercise
- Likely a basic example demonstrating memory management with dynamic allocation.

### PythonLists
#### Objects in OOP
- Objects are instances of classes containing attributes (data) and methods (functions).
- They represent real-world entities or concepts.

#### Benefits of OOP
- **Reusability:** Inheritance allows existing classes to be reused, reducing redundancy.
- **Maintainability:** Changes in one part of the code have minimal impact elsewhere.
- **Scalability:** OOP makes it easy to expand systems with new classes and objects.
- Overall, OOP provides flexibility, reusability, and maintainability in code design.

### Linked Lists
- Linked lists solve memory allocation issues by dynamically assigning values and linking them arbitrarily.
- Useful for dynamic data storage and creating an ordered sequence of elements.
- Example output:
  ```
  Linked List: 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> NULL
  ```

### Managing Allocation
- Demonstrates controlled dynamic memory allocation and management.
- Example output:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 ... 44 %
  ```

### Headers in C
- Custom headers require a different compilation process than standard library headers.
- Header files (`.h`) provide function declarations, while implementation is in separate `.c` files.
- Compilation methodology must be adjusted to properly include custom headers.
